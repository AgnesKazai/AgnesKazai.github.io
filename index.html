        <h4>Junior software developer</h4>

        <p>
            Iâ€™m interested in computer science, music, sport and swedish language. Computers first appered in my life when I was 11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I noticed that I could do a
            lot more things with the computer, for example programming...

        <h3>Boolean Logic</h3>

        <p> It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on
            one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
        </p>
        <h3>Character Code (ASCII)</h3>
        <p>
            It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical
            representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.


        </p>
        <h3>RAM</h3>
        <p>
            It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of
            a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective
            of the physical location of data inside the memory.
        </p>
        <h3>ALU</h3>
        <p>
            A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally
            consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
        </p>
        <h3>DNS</h3>
        <p>
            A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private
            network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
        </p>
        <h3>Internet protocol</h3>
        <p>
            An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data
